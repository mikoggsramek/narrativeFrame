            @Jump back. >The door swings open, slamming into the wall behind it.
                @Touch the door gingerly. >jmp03
            @Brace yourself. >The door slams into you. You're dead.
        @Try harder. >It opens with a thud.
            @Enter the door. >A gloved hand grabs your mouth and a bag covers your head. Darkness consumes you.
    @Look around the room. >There's a door in front of you. A dark hallway to your right, and a bright opening behind you.
        @Knock on the door. >jmp02
        @Go down the dark hallway. >You blindly feel your way down the hallway. Your hand touches something furry.
        @Leave. >jmp01
    @Leave. >You turn around and go home. *01
        @Go to sleep. >You fall asleep peacefully.
